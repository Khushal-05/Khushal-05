### 🚀 About Me

Hey! I'm **Khushal**, a curious developer who loves building, breaking, and learning from tech.  
Currently pursuing **B.Tech in Computer Science & Engineering at Amity University Rajasthan**,  
I enjoy turning ideas into code — from solving algorithmic puzzles to crafting interactive web apps and automation workflows.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me exploring **AI, game mechanics**, or automating something cool with **n8n**.  
I also share my passion for gaming on my **YouTube channel**, where I play titles like *Valorant* and *Need for Speed*.

### 💡 What I Love Working On
- 🧠 **Data Structures & Algorithms** — writing clean, efficient logic  
- 🌐 **Web Development** — from design to deployment  
- ⚙️ **Automation & APIs** — building smart workflows with **n8n**, **Ngrok**, and **Google APIs**  
- 🤖 **AI / ML Foundations** — learning models and experimenting with **AWS Machine Learning**  
- 🎮 **Game Development** — creating projects that blend logic with creativity
